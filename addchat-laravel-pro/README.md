### All-in-one multi-purpose Chat Widget For Laravel websites

AddChat is a new chatting friend of Laravel. It's a standalone Chat widget that uses the website's existing `users` base, and let website users chat with each other. 

You get full source-code, hence AddChat lives and runs on your server/hosting including database. And therefore, you get complete privacy over your data. Either you're a big corporate sector or a small business. AddChat is for everyone.

## Technical Specification

AddChat is very light, high performance, scalable and secure.

1. AddChat front-end built with **VueJs**, which is purely API based web-app.

2. AddChat back-end (API) built with **Laravel**

    - **AddChat Laravel** version is a Laravel package, hence, can be installed via **Composer** in an existing or a fresh Laravel website.



## User Interface & Design

AddChat is designed in **CSS Flexbox** and **Sass**. Let's see what's so special about **CSS Flexbox** and why we used it.

1. AddChat is a CSS Framework Independent. Means, no matter in which CSS Framework your website is in, it neither affects the website CSS nor gets affected by it.

    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
    - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) 
    - [Materializecss](https://materializecss.com/) 
    - [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) 
    - [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) 
    - [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) 

    or any other...

2. AddChat CSS is completely encapsulated (wrapped in AddChat wrapper with `#addchat-bot .c-` prefix).
    - Hence, it never override your website CSS nor inherits from it.

    - AddChat UI is extra-responsive. Optimized for **extra-small** devices to large **4K desktops** -

        * Small phones
        * Android Phones
        * iPhones
        * iPad & iPad Pro
        * Small-Medium Size Laptops
        * Large Desktops

3. We've used the popular **NPM** package `auto-prefixer` to make the AddChat UI design same across all types of browsers e.g `Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge` etc



## Multi-regional

AddChat is compatible with all languages and timezones. AddChat auto adapts and adjust regional settings according to your website's default timezone and language. Please refer to the Language section for more info about **adding a new language** in 
[AddChat Laravel](https://addchat-pro-docs.classiebit.com/docs/1.0/admin/multi-language-laravel)

--- 

AddChat never breaks any of your website functionality, even if something went wrong with AddChat, there are `fallback modes` for every worst-case scenario.

# Laravel Installation

AddChat can be installed via composer. Smooth... üçª


## Prerequisites

* Laravel version 5.5 / 5.6 / 5.7 / 5.8 / 6.x
* Make sure to install AddChat package on a **Fresh** or **Existing** Laravel application. 
* We also assume that you've setup the database.
* If you're running MySql version older than < 5.7 then disable strict mode in Laravel `config/database.php` `'strict' => false`


## Install

1. If installing AddChat on an existing Laravel application and you already have **Auth** system then **skip this step**

    If installing on a **Fresh Laravel application** then run 

    **For Laravel 5.5 to 5.8**

    ```php
    php artisan make:auth

    php artisan migrate
    ```

    **For Laravel 6.x**

    ```php
    composer require laravel/ui --dev

    php artisan ui vue --auth

    npm install && npm run dev

    php artisan migrate
    ```


2. Unzip the `addchat-laravel-pro.zip` file, copy the `addchat-laravel-pro` folder and place it in your Laravel application root directory.

    - The folder name must be `addchat-laravel-pro` in your Laravel website directory.
    

3. Open your Laravel application `composer.json` file and paste the below code in the end (right before last curly `}` bracket)

    ```json
    "repositories": [{
        "type": "path",
        "url": "addchat-laravel-pro/"
    }]
    ```

    (once you complete, the `composer.json` file will look something like this) 

    ```json
    {

            "post-autoload-dump": [
                "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
                "@php artisan package:discover --ansi"
            ],
            "post-root-package-install": [
                "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\""
            ],
            "post-create-project-cmd": [
                "@php artisan key:generate --ansi"
            ]
        },


        "repositories": [{
            "type": "path",
            "url": "addchat-laravel-pro/"
        }]

    }

    ```

    php artisan addchat:install
    ```


6. While installation, it will ask you for the license code. Enter the license code to complete the installation process.

    - Remember, one license code is valid for one domain only. Contact support for more details.


7. Open the common layout file, mostly the common layout file is the file which contains the HTML & BODY tags.

    - Copy AddChat CSS code and paste it right before closing **&lt;/head&gt;** tag

        ```php
        <!-- 1. Addchat css -->
        <link href="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/css/addchat.min.css') ?>" rel="stylesheet">
        ```
    
    - Copy AddChat Widget code and paste it right after opening **&lt;body&gt;** tag

        ```php
        <!-- 2. AddChat widget -->
        <div id="addchat_app" 
            data-baseurl="<?php echo url('') ?>"
            data-csrfname="<?php echo 'X-CSRF-Token' ?>"
            data-csrftoken="<?php echo csrf_token() ?>"
        ></div>
        ```

    - Copy AddChat JS code and paste it right before closing **&lt;/body&gt;** tag

        ```php
        <!-- 3. AddChat JS -->
        <!-- Modern browsers -->
        <script type="module" src="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/js/addchat.min.js') ?>"></script>
        <!-- Fallback support for Older browsers -->
        <script nomodule src="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/js/addchat-legacy.min.js') ?>"></script>
        ```

    - Please replace **&lt;php ?>** tag by **{{}}** curly brackets.


    #### The final layout will look something like this

    ```php
    <head>

        <!-- **** your site other content **** -->

        <!-- 1. Addchat css -->
        <link href="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/css/addchat.min.css') ?>" rel="stylesheet">

    </head>
    <body>

        <!-- 2. AddChat widget -->
        <div id="addchat_app" 
            data-baseurl="<?php echo url('') ?>"
            data-csrfname="<?php echo 'X-CSRF-Token' ?>"
            data-csrftoken="<?php echo csrf_token() ?>"
        ></div>


        
        <!-- **** your site other content **** -->



        <!-- 3. AddChat JS -->
        <!-- 3. AddChat JS -->
        <!-- Modern browsers -->
        <script type="module" src="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/js/addchat.min.js') ?>"></script>
        <!-- Fallback support for Older browsers -->
        <script nomodule src="<?php echo asset('assets/addchat/js/addchat-legacy.min.js') ?>"></script>

    </body>
    ```

---

- For Info, the `php artisan addchat:install` publishes AddChat assets to your application `public/assets` directory

---

- `addchat.min.js` for modern browsers & `addchat-legacy.min.js` for older browsers. These will be used switched by the browsers automatically on the basis on `type="module"` & `nomodule`, you need to nothing.
